## Privacy Policy for Piggy48!

![Image](img/banner.png)

Marc Vandehey built the Piggy48 app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Marc Vandehey and is intended for use as is. 

I will not store your data. I don't want it, nor do I have any means to do it. I built this game using Godot! 

I am working on having the least amount of permissions that I can for this app. The current goal is 0 permissions.

Currently with Godot 3.1 I have to ask for the RECORD_AUDIO permission. This is a new feature for the platform and I expect it to be optional in the future. 

The game should not ask for this permission at any time, and if for some reason that it does please deny it.
